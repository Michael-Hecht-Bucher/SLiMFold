Prerun_v1.1 notes:

- define input more clearly: which fasta does the user need to provide? 
- 0: rename "a3m" folder maybe to "MSA_a3m-format", "MSA_sto-format", "MSA_sorted" etc for clarity? 
- 1A-line33 ValueError => maybe include feedback for trimming sequences?

Installation
git clone {URL_of_our_repo}
cd slim_af2_screen
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate {env_name_from_yml_file}

Install PsiPred 4.0 
follow the steps provided in https://github.com/psipred/psipred
cd ./psipred/src
make
make install
In order to be able to run PsiPred outside its own folder, open the "runpsipred_single" C shell script and change the relative paths of "set execdir" and "set datadir" to absolute paths like this:
	# Where the PSIPRED V4 programs have been installed
	set execdir = /home/michael/psipred/bin

	# Where the PSIPRED V4 data files have been installed
	set datadir = /home/michael/psipred/data

Install IUPred3
obtain the "iupred3.tar.gz" archive from https://iupred3.elte.hu/download_new
Untar the archive with:
	tar -xvzf iupred3.tar.gz

Download and untar/unzip required databases 
 - UniRef90: https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref90/uniref90.fasta.gz
 - NCBI protein database (Homo sapiens or other organism of choice): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/9606/?

Register the conda environment as a Jupyter kernel:
conda activate SLiM_AF2_screen
python -m ipykernel install --user --name SLiM_AF2_screen --display-name "SLiM_AF2_screen"
From within jupyterlab or VScode, select the kernel "SLiM_AF2_screen" to initialize the correct environment 

Create your input
Create a fasta file with short linear motifs (SLiMs) which you initially would like to screen. Take care to already have the sequences aligned and make sure that sequences have the same length. Below is an example input.fasta file
	>Lifeact
	VADLIKKFE
	>ITPKA
	VGELRLLFE

Prepare the project folder structure
Within the "Prerun" jupyter notebook, activate the previously registered "SLiM_AF2_screen" kernel and execute the first cell to set up your project folder structure. The folder will be created in your current working directory.

Create the PSSM
Move the "input.fasta" file to the subfolder "Input" and proceed with step 1A or 1B in the "Prerun" notebook to create the PSSM.

Run PSSM search
For PAM30-based PSSM search, start with pssm_cutoff = 0
For BLOSUM62-based PSSM search, use pssm_cutoff = 10
